Future
======================================================
Map file type
Overhaul of graphics
Decide whether to move Main loop to Territorial class or not
Optimise Button Animations
Look for more accurate way to cap frame rate other than window.setFramerateLimit()
Update Comments throughout code (stdafx also)
	-ViewManager.cpp
	-Territory.cpp

- Loading Screen Parent class (abstract), that lets you add anything for rendering
	-Perhaps loading screen that takes Image/Video as parameter
