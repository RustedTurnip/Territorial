v0.8.0 -- Current
------
- Change versioning so that the  '-dev' suffix appended to the last version, not the anticipated next one
- Introduce unit circles to territories - using default colour for now untl player colours are introduced

- Add notion of players
	-On a players turn, they may choose a territory and that players colour will become that of the territories
		as a means to test the player inclusion (i.e. this feature will be ~temporary)








Future
======================================================
vx.x.x
------
- To do below, will need to re-locate the Continent Identifiers to somewhere more appropriate
	- And will need to move State changes to Viewmanager (most apt place if declared as static I think)
- Implement resource manager/handler as can't continue in current state

vx.x.x
------
-Introduce source code sub-structure
-Introduce a Map reader as Map shouldn't be responsible for having to load itself



Map file type
Overhaul of graphics
Decide whether to move Main loop to Territorial class or not
Optimise Button Animations
Look for more accurate way to cap frame rate other than window.setFramerateLimit()
Update Comments throughout code (stdafx also)
	-ViewManager.cpp
	-Territory.cpp

---------------------------------
Global Font (and other resources)
Flesh this out (and tidy up)
---------------------------------


- Loading Screen Parent class (abstract), that lets you add anything for rendering
	-Perhaps loading screen that takes Image/Video as parameter


Post v1.0.0
